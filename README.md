apca
====

- [Documentation][docs-rs]
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

**apca** is a library for interacting with the Alpaca API at
[alpaca.markets][]. The crate is entirely written in Rust and exposes a
fully async API based on the native `async`/`await` language feature.

The crate provides access to the majority of functionality provided by
Alpaca, including, but not limited to:
- inquiring of account information
- changing of the account configuration
- retrieving of past account activity
- accessing the market clock
- submitting, changing, listing, and canceling orders
- listing and closing open positions
- listing and retrieving general asset information
- streaming of account and trade events over WebSocket
- market data retrieval through Alpaca's Data API (for Polygon support
  refer to the [`polyio`][polyio] crate)

For convenient command-line based access to the API, please use
[`apcacli`][apcacli].


Usage
-----

The following example illustrates how to create a `Client` object and
then submit a limit order for `AAPL` with a limit price of USD 100:
```rust
let api_info = ApiInfo::from_env().unwrap();
let client = Client::new(api_info);

let request = order::OrderReqInit {
  type_: Type::Limit,
  limit_price: Some(Num::from(100)),
  ..Default::default()
}
.init("AAPL", Side::Buy, 1);

let order = client
  .issue::<order::Post>(request)
  .await
  .unwrap();
```

The returned `order` object can subsequently be inspected to find out
details about the order (such as its ID). The full example is available
[here][example-order].

Please refer to the full [documentation][docs-rs] for more details.
